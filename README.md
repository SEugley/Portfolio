### Projects

#### Data De-Identification
Risk assessment of a telecom survey dataset to evaluate the potential for customer re-identification was performed. Statistical methods and probabilistic algorithms were applied across four scenarios: intentional attack, unintentional recognition, data breaches, and public disclosure. Equivalence classes for quasi-identifiers, ensuring adequate group sizes to reduce re-identification risks, were established. Data quality controls, variable masking, and data grouping strategies were implemented to successfully mitigate risks while preserving the datasetâ€™s utility.

#### Predictive Modeling for Stroke Risk and Life Expectancy
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze healthcare data, specifically targeting stroke risk prediction and life expectancy estimation. By employing a range of predictive models, including regression techniques, decision trees, and ensemble methods, the analysis compares their effectiveness. This analysis also identifies key health predictors as they pertain to life expectancy and stroke risk.

#### Customer Segmentation and Profiling
Customer segmentation and profiling analysis for a telecom company to enhance customer retention. Two approaches were explored: a decision tree model and a value-based segmentation method. The value-based approach categorized customers into eight distinct profiles based on tenure, monthly spending, and premium service usage. Key findings revealed patterns in customer behavior across different age groups and spending habits across profiles.

### What am I Currently Working on?
This analysis utilizes 2019-2022 hospital readmission data from the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) to identify key risk factors influencing readmission rates for hip and knee replacement patients. Using a Random Forest model, we aim to pinpoint the most significant predictors of readmission. Additionally, we are implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models to predict hospital readmission rates and classify hospitals as either 'preferred' or 'non-preferred' for hip/knee replacement surgery patients, leveraging the latest 2024 HRRP data.
#### This is a collaborative project.
